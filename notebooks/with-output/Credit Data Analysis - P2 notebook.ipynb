For more information, see <a href=\"https://dataplatform.cloud.ibm.com/docs/content/wsj/analyze-data/autoai-notebook.html\">Cloud Platform</a> \n","- Before modifying the pipeline or trying to re-fit the pipeline, consider that the code converts dataframes to numpy arrays before fitting the pipeline (a current restriction of the preprocessor pipeline).\n"]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":["<a id=\"content\"></a>\n","## Notebook content\n","\n","This notebook contains a Scikit-learn representation of AutoAI pipeline.
